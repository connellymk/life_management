## TRAINING PRINCIPLES & EXECUTION NOTES

### Heart Rate Zones (Estimated based on easy pace of 9:45/mile)
- **Zone 1:** Very easy, < 65% max HR, conversational
- **Zone 2:** Easy-moderate, 65-75% max HR, can hold conversation
- **Zone 3:** Moderate-hard, 75-85% max HR, can speak in short sentences
- **Zone 4:** Hard, 85-95% max HR, few words only
- **Zone 5:** Maximum, > 95% max HR, racing effort

### Pace Guidelines
- **Easy runs:** 9:30-10:30/mile on flat terrain (slower on trails/hills)
- **Tempo runs:** 8:30-9:00/mile on flat (effort-based on hills)
- **Long runs:** 10:00-11:00/mile average (highly variable with terrain)
- **Race day:** Variable, likely 12-16 min/mile average with all the climbing

### Nutrition Practice
- **All long runs (90+ min):** Practice race nutrition
- **Target:** 200-250 calories/hour
- **Hydration:** 16-24 oz/hour (adjust for conditions)
- **Test:** Gels, chews, bars, real food - find what works

### Strength Training Focus Areas
- **Glutes:** Single-leg deadlifts, hip thrusts, step-ups
- **Quads:** Squats, Bulgarian split squats, step-downs
- **Core:** Planks, dead bugs, pallof press, anti-rotation
- **Ankles:** Calf raises, single-leg balance work
- **General:** Maintain throughout, reduce during peak/taper

### Adaptations & Flexibility
- **Weather:** If conditions are unsafe, move runs indoors or swap days
- **Fatigue:** If overly fatigued, take extra rest - better undertrained than injured
- **Illness:** If sick, take time off until recovered
- **Trail conditions:** Winter snow = more treadmill/stairstepper; spring/summer = more outdoor trails

### Key Training Locations (Bozeman Area)
- **M Trail:** Great for hill repeats, accessible year-round
- **Drinking Horse Mountain:** Longer sustained climbing
- **Hyalite Canyon:** Technical trails, altitude training
- **Bridger Range:** High-altitude training, race-specific terrain

- [ ] Course study: review elevation profile, aid station locations
