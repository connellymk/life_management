## airtable/calendar.py

**Archived**: January 31, 2026

**Reason**: Calendar sync migrated back to Notion. The project now uses `notion/calendar.py` for syncing Google Calendar events to the Notion Calendar Events database.

**Replaced by**: `notion/calendar.py`

The Airtable calendar sync was functional but the decision was made to centralize data in Notion instead of Airtable for calendar events.
